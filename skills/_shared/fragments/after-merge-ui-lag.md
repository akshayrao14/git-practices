## After merge — UI lag

GitHub's Dependabot UI counts often lag the actual fix by 5–30 minutes. If the user reports "only N alerts closed, you predicted M" shortly after merge, don't assume the fix was incomplete. Verify via API first:

```bash
# Open axios alerts in this repo right now
gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/dependabot/alerts?state=open&per_page=100" --jq '[.[] | select(.dependency.package.name=="<pkg>")] | length'

# Fixed-today list (sanity check the merge actually closed them)
gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/dependabot/alerts?state=fixed&per_page=100" --jq '[.[] | select(.dependency.package.name=="<pkg>" and (.fixed_at | startswith("'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)"'")))] | length'
```

If API confirms fix but UI still shows old count, reassure the user — it's UI lag, not a regression. The API is the source of truth. UI typically catches up within an hour after the lockfile push.
